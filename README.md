# Unit 14 Assessment: Intro to JavaScript and jQuery



## Part 1: Book Learning

There's so much to know about JavaScript and jQuery!
Take [this longer-than-usual quiz](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1bBTY8h2IXbmeYldBXKAxTCsA1xy7rFW64mXZLXDA4ec/viewform) about them.

## Part 2: Comb Sort

You've implemented bubble sort as part of the course work.
Now read up on a variation called [comb sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comb_sort).
There is psuedocode included with that link.

Implement comb sort with JavaScript, and comment your code to explain what each part of the algorithm does.

Open `comb-sort/combSort.js` to get coding.
To test the code quickly, open `comb-sort/index.html` in your browser to run [QUnit](https://qunitjs.com) tests.



## Part 3: Grocery CRUD

Create a dirt simple grocery list app with JavaScript and jQuery.

Open `groceries/index.html` in your browser to view the app.
Add your code to `groceries/groceries.js`.

### Features:

1. Add a grocery item via a form
1. Remove a grocery item via a delete button next to the item in the list
1. If the value submitted by the form is empty, do NOT create an item in the list

### **BONUS**

1. Show a `No groceries` message when there are no items in the list
1. Show a flash message when a item is added/removed
1. Show a flash message if the form submit value is empty

### Styling

**Bootstrap has been provided for you, but styling is not required.**
**Don't lose time trying to make it pretty!**
